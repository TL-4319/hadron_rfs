If a dataset does not have a gnss location header, copy it from a previous test. Hadron position should have remained the same between tests with an error of no more than a centimeter.

If a dataset has multiple data headers, the python script was just run multiple times before actually recording data. Just delete any duplicates.

Two supers were tracked during the two test flights. Any additional objects detected in the data set were the hadron's picking up on individual componenets of the closest super. Either delete the second dataset or find the average. Both should provide similar results.
